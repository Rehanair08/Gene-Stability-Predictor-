# Gene-Stability-Predictor-
## About the Project 
Gene Stability Predictor is a lightweight, easy-to-use web tool that analyzes a given DNA sequence and predicts its stability based on several critical biological factors, including:

- GC content
- Melting temperature
- Palindrome detection
- Dinucleotide ratios
- Hairpin structure detection
- Sequence repetition analysis
** Deployed link: https://rehanair08.github.io/Gene-Stability-Predictor-/
## How it Works
- **Input**: Paste or type your DNA sequence into the tool.
- **Analysis**: The tool checks multiple biological parameters that influence gene stability.
- **Output**: It gives a prediction (e.g., Moderately Stable) with a full breakdown of the analysis.
